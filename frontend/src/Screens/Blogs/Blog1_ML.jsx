            The Machine Learning Product Lifecycle
          </h2>
          <p>
            The lifecycle is iterative and includes stages such as scoping, data
            collection, modeling, and deployment. Each stage requires careful
            consideration and often revisiting to refine the project's goals and
            processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scoping involves defining project objectives and variables. Data
            collection is about gathering relevant data for model training and
            testing, which may involve extracting and labeling data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Modeling entails training and fine-tuning algorithms while
            evaluating their performance. Deployment is when the model is put
            into production, followed by monitoring and maintenance to ensure
            its effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite being the final stage, deployment is not the end of the
            process. It involves addressing data and software engineering
            challenges. Data issues include drift and concept changes over time,
            while software engineering issues concern system resources and
            functionalities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Various deployment strategies exist, including shadow mode, canary
            deployment, and blue/green deployment, each offering different
            levels of risk management and scalability.
          </p>
          <p>
            The level of automation varies depending on the project's goals and
            tasks, ranging from human-only systems to full automation. Each
            application may require a different degree of human involvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deployment is an ongoing process that involves monitoring both
            software and data metrics. Thresholds and metrics are set to
            identify when adjustments or model retraining are needed to maintain
            performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deployment is a critical stage in the Machine Learning project
            lifecycle, but it's not the final step. Understanding deployment
            challenges, automation levels, and iterative processes is essential
            for successful project implementation.
